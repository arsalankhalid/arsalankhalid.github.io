description: I worked on a Blockchain payments project, one of the first few blockchain related projects in Canada for Accenture.
The project was primarily an assessment to categorize TD's position on Blockchain, and understand how the bank would use a distributed
ledger solution for cross-border remittance. In the process I came to learn much about how financial institutions perform payments or
move money (clearing & settlement). One of the other great benefactors was that I was able to learn more about different distributed ledger
platforms in the market place, gaining exposure to new FinTech's is always an incredible benefit!
